## My Origin Story
Before I get into software engineering, I need to talk about how I got here. Growing up I always had a fascination with technology and always had to mess around with every new appliance my family would buy from Costco from fans, microwaves, and even TVs. Everything in my house was fair game when it came to me going around the house pressing every button to figure out what it did. This led me to become my household's personal "Geek Squad". I would be called to action everytime a phone call needed to be put on speaker, a VCR tape needed to be rewinded, an iPad needing to be connected to the wifi, and you guessed it, "fixing the internet" by turning the router on and off again. Before heading into college, I used my many years of experience to decide that working with computers would be great and without doing any extra research, I had to decide between Computer Science or Computer Engineering. I didn't know the difference and chose engineering because then my mom could brag to her relatives that I was studying engineering which in turn made me her favorite child (official title, obviously not self proclaimed).
