During my time in this project, I was able to learn a lot about what it meant to conduct scientific research, design lab experiments, and replicate different methods that other researchers have developed. A highlight of my time at the project included a deep dive onto different applications of liquid-metal to optimize the manufacturing procedure for small scale electronics. This led to conducting my own experiment using silicon stamps to apply liquid-metal into finer resolutios using additive and subtractive methods.
