summary: "The Kawailoa Curtailment Project was a cost analysis project using a Python to develop a program that would calculate total energy loss throughout the year based on curtailment data and proposed the development of a Battery Energy Storage System to recover over 23 million dollars of potential revenue."

The Kawailoa Solar Curtailment Project was a result of my six-week internship at Clearway Energy Hawaii located out in Mililani. The internship provided valuable lessons, experience, and connections to the renewable energy industry which was culminated to a final project presentation at the end of internship program with a proposed solution to an aspect of the company that I was interested in.

For this project, I received the mentorship from Jeffrey Craft, a Data Analytics Manager at Clearway Energy. With his guidance, I was able to receive curtailment data from the past year in order to calculate the total lost energy and potential revenue from all the lost energy due to curtailment. 

Below is a snippet of the code that was used to calculate all of the lost energy.

This information combined with a power purchase agreement with HECO, a total figure was obtained and a proposed solution was designed specifically for the Kawailoa Solar Farm out in the North Shore which would save around ten million dollars of lost revenue.
