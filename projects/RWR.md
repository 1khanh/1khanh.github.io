The Rainbow Warrior Racing Team is part of the Mechanical Engineering Department Senior Design Course but I was able to take it for my EE496 Senior Project. Being the only Computer Engineering student on a team full of Mechanical Engineering students, I was assigned to be the Powertrain Subsystem Lead where as a lead, would facilitate communication between the powertrain system to the drivetrain, suspension, chassis, and the team managers. This allowed us to document the different stages of the design process to draft reports, notebooks, and presentations which led to us taking home first place at the Francis Rhodes Montgomery Design Competition.

As for powertrain subsystem, my duties aside from creating the division of labor between a sub-team of five students, I also worked on designing the energy capacity and battery configuration for our high voltage accumulator, drafted different circuit diagrams required for the FSAE EV competition such as the high voltage tractive system and shutdown circuit, and developed high voltage infrastructure including lab space and safety operating procedures for UH Manoa's Mechanical Engineering Shop Space.

Above is the poster created for the EE496 Poster Session that highlights the powertrain subsystem components that I had a part in designing. This includes the battery selection and configuration of the accumulator and accumulator segments, the PCB for cell tab connections, and the accumulator cooling system.
